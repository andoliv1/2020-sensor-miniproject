# Senior Design 2020 Sensor Miniproject
Collaborators: Andreas Francisco, Nnenna Eze

## Questions to think about:
1. How is this simulation reflective of the real world?
2. How is this simulation deficient? What factors does it faill to account for?
3. Difficulty of Python websockets library vs compiled languages
4. Would it be better to have server poll sensors or sensors reach out to server when they have data?
