The variance observed from the temperature data for class1 is: 32.765

The variance observed from the temperature data for office is: 8898.989

The variance observed from the temperature data for lab1 is: 50.665


The median observed from the occupancy data for class1 is: 19

The median observed from the occupancy data is for office is: 2

The median observed from the occupancy data is for lab1 is: 5

The variance observed from the occupancy data is for class1 is: 19.3

The variance observed from the occupancy data is for class1 is: 1.9

The variance observed from the occupancy data is for class1 is: 5.0

## Questions to think about:
1. How is this simulation reflective of the real world?
2. How is this simulation deficient? What factors does it faill to account for?
3. Difficulty of Python websockets library vs compiled languages
4. Would it be better to have server poll sensors or sensors reach out to server when they have data?
